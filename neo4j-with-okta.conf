# Memory Settings
#********************************************************************
#
# Memory settings are specified kibibytes with the 'k' suffix, mebibytes with
# 'm' and gibibytes with 'g'.
# If Neo4j is running on a dedicated server, then it is generally recommended
# to leave about 2-4 gigabytes for the operating system, give the JVM enough
# heap to hold all your transaction state and query context, and then leave the
# rest for the page cache.

# Java Heap Size: by default the Java heap size is dynamically calculated based
# on available system resources. Uncomment these lines to set specific initial
# and maximum heap size.
#server.memory.heap.initial_size=512m
#server.memory.heap.max_size=512m

# The amount of memory to use for mapping the store files.
# The default page cache memory assumes the machine is dedicated to running
# Neo4j, and is heuristically set to 50% of RAM minus the Java heap size.
#server.memory.pagecache.size=10g

# Limit the amount of memory that all of the running transaction can consume.
# The default value is 70% of the heap size limit.

#*****************************************************************
# Network connector configuration
#*****************************************************************

# With default configuration Neo4j only accepts local connections.
# Use 0.0.0.0 to bind to all network interfaces on the machine. If you want to only use a specific interface
# (such as a private IP address on AWS, for example) then use that IP address instead.
#server.default_listen_address=0.0.0.0

# You can also choose a specific network interface, and configure a non-default
# port for each connector, by setting their individual listen_address.

# The address at which this server can be reached by its clients. This may be the server's IP address or DNS name, or
# it may be the address of a reverse proxy which sits in front of the server. This setting may be overridden for
# individual connectors below.
#server.default_advertised_address=localhost

# You can also choose a specific advertised hostname or IP address, and
# configure an advertised port for each connector, by setting their

# SSL policy configuration
#*****************************************************************

# Each policy is configured under a separate namespace, e.g.
#    dbms.ssl.policy.<scope>.*
#    <scope> can be any of 'bolt', 'https', 'cluster' or 'backup'
#
# The scope is the name of the component where the policy will be used
# Each component where the use of an ssl policy is desired needs to declare at least one setting of the policy.
# Allowable values are 'bolt', 'https', 'cluster' or 'backup'.

# E.g if bolt and https connectors should use the same policy, the following could be declared
#   dbms.ssl.policy.bolt.base_directory=certificates/default
#   dbms.ssl.policy.https.base_directory=certificates/default
# However, it's strongly encouraged to not use the same key pair for multiple scopes.
#
# N.B: Note that a connector must be configured to support/require
#      SSL/TLS for the policy to actually be utilized.
#
# see: dbms.connector.*.tls_level

# SSL settings (dbms.ssl.policy.<scope>.*)
#  .base_directory       Base directory for SSL policies paths. All relative paths within the
#                        SSL configuration will be resolved from the base dir.
#
#  .private_key          A path to the key file relative to the '.base_directory'.
#
#  .private_key_password The password for the private key.
#
#  .public_certificate   A path to the public certificate file relative to the '.base_directory'.

#
#  .revoked_dir          Path to the directory with Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).
#
#  .verify_hostname      If true, the server will verify the hostname that the client uses to connect with. In order
#                        for this to work, the server public certificate must have a valid CN and/or matching
#                        Subject Alternative Names.
#
#  .client_auth          How the client should be authorized. Possible values are: 'none', 'optional', 'require'.
#
#  .tls_versions         A comma-separated list of allowed TLS versions. By default only TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 are allowed.
#
#  .trust_all            Setting this to 'true' will ignore the trust truststore, trusting all clients and servers.
#                        Use of this mode is discouraged. It would offer encryption but no security.
#

# Cluster Load Balancing
#*****************************************************************

# N.B: Read the online documentation for a thorough explanation!

# Selects the load balancing plugin that shall be enabled.
#dbms.routing.load_balancing.plugin=server_policies

####### Examples for "server_policies" plugin #######

# Will select all available servers as the default policy, which is the
# policy used when the client does not specify a policy preference. The
# default configuration for the default policy is all().
#dbms.routing.load_balancing.config.server_policies.default=all()

# Will select servers in groups 'group1' or 'group2' under the default policy.
#dbms.routing.load_balancing.config.server_policies.default=groups(group1,group2)

# Slightly more advanced example:
# Will select servers in 'group1', 'group2' or 'group3', but only if there are at least 2.
# This policy will be exposed under the name of 'mypolicy'.
#dbms.routing.load_balancing.config.server_policies.mypolicy=groups(group1,group2,group3) -> min(2)

# Below will create an even more advanced policy named 'regionA' consisting of several rules
# yielding the following behaviour:
#
#            select servers in regionA, if at least 2 are available
# otherwise: select servers in regionA and regionB, if at least 2 are available
# otherwise: select all servers
#
# The intention is to create a policy for a particular region which prefers
# a certain set of local servers, but which will fallback to other regions
# or all available servers as required.
#
# N.B: The following configuration uses the line-continuation character \
#      which allows you to construct an easily readable rule set spanning
#      several lines.
#
#dbms.routing.load_balancing.config.server_policies.policyA=\
#groups(regionA) -> min(2);\
#groups(regionA,regionB) -> min(2);

# Note that implicitly the last fallback is to always consider all() servers,

# Cluster Additional Configuration Options
#*****************************************************************
# The following settings are used less frequently.

# Cluster Routing Connector. Disable the opening of an additional port to allow
# for internal communication using the same security configuration as CLUSTER
#dbms.routing.enabled=false

# The time window within which the loss of the leader is detected and the first re-election attempt is held.
# The window should be significantly larger than typical communication delays to make conflicts unlikely.
#dbms.cluster.raft.leader_failure_detection_window=20s-23s

# The rate at which leader elections happen. Note that due to election conflicts it might take several attempts to
# find a leader. The window should be significantly larger than typical communication delays to make conflicts unlikely.
#dbms.cluster.raft.election_failure_detection_window=3s-6s

# The time limit allowed for a new member to attempt to update its data to match the rest of the cluster.
#dbms.cluster.raft.membership.join_timeout=10m

# Maximum amount of lag accepted for a new follower to join the Raft group.
#dbms.cluster.raft.membership.join_max_lag=10s

# Raft log pruning frequency.
#dbms.cluster.raft.log.pruning_frequency=10m

# The size to allow the raft log to grow before rotating.
#dbms.cluster.raft.log.rotation_size=250M

# The name of a server_group whose members should be prioritized as leaders for the given database.
# This does not guarantee that members of this group will be leader at all times, but the cluster
# will attempt to transfer leadership to such a member when possible.
# N.B. the final portion of this config key is dynamic and refers to the name of the database being configured.
# You may specify multiple `db.cluster.raft.leader_transfer.priority_group.<database-name>=<server-group>` pairs:
#db.cluster.raft.leader_transfer.priority_group.foo=
#db.cluster.raft.leader_transfer.priority_group.neo4j=

# Which strategy to use when transferring database leaderships around a cluster.
# This can be one of `equal_balancing` or `no_balancing`.
# `equal_balancing` automatically ensures that each Core server holds the leader role for an equal number of databases.
# `no_balancing` prevents any automatic balancing of the leader role.
# Note that if a `leadership_priority_group` is specified for a given database,
# the value of this setting will be ignored for that database.

#db.cluster.catchup.pull_interval=1s

#********************************************************************
# Security Configuration
#********************************************************************

# The authentication and authorization providers that contains both users and roles.

#dbms.security.auth_cache_ttl=10m

# The maximum capacity for authentication and authorization caches (respectively).
#dbms.security.auth_cache_max_capacity=10000

# Set to log successful authentication events to the security log.

#dbms.security.log_successful_authentication=true

#================================================
# LDAP Auth Provider Configuration
#================================================

# URL of LDAP server to use for authentication and authorization.
# The format of the setting is `<protocol>://<hostname>:<port>`, where hostname is the only required field.
# The supported values for protocol are `ldap` (default) and `ldaps`.
# The default port for `ldap` is 389 and for `ldaps` 636.
# For example: `ldaps://ldap.example.com:10389`.
#
# NOTE: You may want to consider using STARTTLS (`dbms.security.ldap.use_starttls`) instead of LDAPS
# for secure connections, in which case the correct protocol is `ldap`.
#dbms.security.ldap.host=localhost

# Use secure communication with the LDAP server using opportunistic TLS.
# First an initial insecure connection will be made with the LDAP server, and then a STARTTLS command
# will be issued to negotiate an upgrade of the connection to TLS before initiating authentication.
#dbms.security.ldap.use_starttls=false

# The LDAP referral behavior when creating a connection. This is one of `follow`, `ignore` or `throw`.
# `follow` automatically follows any referrals
# `ignore` ignores any referrals
# `throw` throws an exception, which will lead to authentication failure
#dbms.security.ldap.referral=follow

# The timeout for establishing an LDAP connection. If a connection with the LDAP server cannot be
# established within the given time the attempt is aborted.
# A value of 0 means to use the network protocol's (i.e., TCP's) timeout value.
#dbms.security.ldap.connection_timeout=30s

# The timeout for an LDAP read request (i.e. search). If the LDAP server does not respond within
# the given time the request will be aborted. A value of 0 means wait for a response indefinitely.
#dbms.security.ldap.read_timeout=30s

#----------------------------------
# LDAP Authentication Configuration
#----------------------------------

# LDAP authentication mechanism. This is one of `simple` or a SASL mechanism supported by JNDI,
# for example `DIGEST-MD5`. `simple` is basic username
# and password authentication and SASL is used for more advanced mechanisms. See RFC 2251 LDAPv3
# documentation for more details.
#dbms.security.ldap.authentication.mechanism=simple

# LDAP user DN template. An LDAP object is referenced by its distinguished name (DN), and a user DN is
# an LDAP fully-qualified unique user identifier. This setting is used to generate an LDAP DN that
# conforms with the LDAP directory's schema from the user principal that is submitted with the
# authentication token when logging in.
# The special token {0} is a placeholder where the user principal will be substituted into the DN string.
#dbms.security.ldap.authentication.user_dn_template=uid={0},ou=users,dc=example,dc=com

# Determines if the result of authentication via the LDAP server should be cached or not.
# Caching is used to limit the number of LDAP requests that have to be made over the network
# for users that have already been authenticated successfully. A user can be authenticated against
# an existing cache entry (instead of via an LDAP server) as long as it is alive
# (see `dbms.security.auth_cache_ttl`).
# An important consequence of setting this to `true` is that
# Neo4j then needs to cache a hashed version of the credentials in order to perform credentials
# matching. This hashing is done using a cryptographic hash function together with a random salt.
# Preferably a conscious decision should be made if this method is considered acceptable by
# the security standards of the organization in which this Neo4j instance is deployed.
#dbms.security.ldap.authentication.cache_enabled=true

#----------------------------------
# LDAP Authorization Configuration
#----------------------------------
# Authorization is performed by searching the directory for the groups that
# the user is a member of, and then map those groups to Neo4j roles.

# Perform LDAP search for authorization info using a system account instead of the user's own account.
#
# If this is set to `false` (default), the search for group membership will be performed
# directly after authentication using the LDAP context bound with the user's own account.
# The mapped roles will be cached for the duration of `dbms.security.auth_cache_ttl`,
# and then expire, requiring re-authentication. To avoid frequently having to re-authenticate
# sessions you may want to set a relatively long auth cache expiration time together with this option.
# NOTE: This option will only work if the users are permitted to search for their
# own group membership attributes in the directory.
#
# If this is set to `true`, the search will be performed using a special system account user
# with read access to all the users in the directory.
# You need to specify the username and password using the settings
# `dbms.security.ldap.authorization.system_username` and
# `dbms.security.ldap.authorization.system_password` with this option.
# Note that this account only needs read access to the relevant parts of the LDAP directory
# and does not need to have access rights to Neo4j, or any other systems.
#dbms.security.ldap.authorization.use_system_account=false

# An LDAP system account username to use for authorization searches when
# `dbms.security.ldap.authorization.use_system_account` is `true`.
# Note that the `dbms.security.ldap.authentication.user_dn_template` will not be applied to this username,
# so you may have to specify a full DN.
#dbms.security.ldap.authorization.system_username=

# An LDAP system account password to use for authorization searches when
# `dbms.security.ldap.authorization.use_system_account` is `true`.
#dbms.security.ldap.authorization.system_password=

# The name of the base object or named context to search for user objects when LDAP authorization is enabled.
# A common case is that this matches the last part of `dbms.security.ldap.authentication.user_dn_template`.
#dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_base=ou=users,dc=example,dc=com

# The LDAP search filter to search for a user principal when LDAP authorization is
# enabled. The filter should contain the placeholder token {0} which will be substituted for the
# user principal.
#dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_filter=(&(objectClass=*)(uid={0}))

# A list of attribute names on a user object that contains groups to be used for mapping to roles
# when LDAP authorization is enabled. This setting is ignored when `dbms.ldap_authorization_nested_groups_enabled` is `true`.
#dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_membership_attributes=memberOf

# This setting determines whether multiple LDAP search results will be processed (as is required for the lookup of nested groups).
# If set to `true` then instead of using attributes on the user object to determine group membership (as specified by
# `dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_membership_attributes`), the `user` object will only be used to determine the user's
# Distinguished Name, which will subsequently be used with  `dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_filter`
# in order to perform a nested group search. The Distinguished Names of the resultant group search results will be used to determine roles.
#dbms.security.ldap.authorization.nested_groups_enabled=false

# The search template which will be used to find the nested groups which the user is a member of.
# The filter should contain the placeholder token `{0}` which will be substituted with the user's
# Distinguished Name (which is found for the specified user principle using `dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_filter`).
# The default value specifies Active Directory's LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN (aka 1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941) implementation
# which will walk the ancestry of group membership for the specified user.
#dbms.security.ldap.authorization.nested_groups_search_filter=(&(objectclass=group)(member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:={0}))

# An authorization mapping from LDAP group names to Neo4j role names.
# The map should be formatted as a semicolon separated list of key-value pairs, where the
# key is the LDAP group name and the value is a comma separated list of corresponding role names.
# For example: group1=role1;group2=role2;group3=role3,role4,role5
#
# You could also use whitespaces and quotes around group names to make this mapping more readable,
# for example: dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_to_role_mapping=\

# Compresses the metric archive files.
server.metrics.csv.rotation.compression=zip

# Determines if Cypher will allow using file URLs when loading data using
# `LOAD CSV`. Setting this value to `false` will cause Neo4j to fail `LOAD CSV`
# clauses that load data from the file system.
#dbms.security.allow_csv_import_from_file_urls=true


# Value of the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header sent over any HTTP or HTTPS
# connector. This defaults to '*', which allows broadest compatibility. Note
# that any URI provided here limits HTTP/HTTPS access to that URI only.
#dbms.security.http_access_control_allow_origin=*

# Value of the HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) response header. This header
# tells browsers that a webpage should only be accessed using HTTPS instead of HTTP.
# It is attached to every HTTPS response. Setting is not set by default so
# 'Strict-Transport-Security' header is not sent. Value is expected to contain
# directives like 'max-age', 'includeSubDomains' and 'preload'.
#dbms.security.http_strict_transport_security=

# Retention policy for transaction logs needed to perform recovery and backups.

# Limit the number of IOs the background checkpoint process will consume per second.
# This setting is advisory, is ignored in Neo4j Community Edition, and is followed to
# best effort in Enterprise Edition.
# An IO is in this case a 8 KiB (mostly sequential) write. Limiting the write IO in
# this way will leave more bandwidth in the IO subsystem to service random-read IOs,
# which is important for the response time of queries when the database cannot fit
# entirely in memory. The only drawback of this setting is that longer checkpoint times
# may lead to slightly longer recovery times in case of a database or system crash.
# A lower number means lower IO pressure, and consequently longer checkpoint times.
# Set this to -1 to disable the IOPS limit and remove the limitation entirely,
# this will let the checkpointer flush data as fast as the hardware will go.
# Removing the setting, or commenting it out, will set the default value of 600.
# db.checkpoint.iops.limit=600

# Whether or not any database on this instance are read_only by default.
# If false, individual databases may be marked as read_only using dbms.database.read_only.
# If true, individual databases may be marked as writable using dbms.databases.writable.

# Comma separated list of JAX-RS packages containing JAX-RS resources, one
